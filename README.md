What is Advent of Code?
-----------------------

**Advent of Code** is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

Dependencies
------------

NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Usage
-----

In folder `days` are subfolders for each day, which contains this files:

- `README.md` - a description of the problem of the day
- `partX_input.txt` - input data for solving
- `partX_solution.js` - script which solve the problem (there you can try write your own :wink:)
- `partX_test.js` - test for solving script

At first you must install dependencies by `npm install` and then you can try:

- `npm run start 05_1` - run solving script for  specific day and its part (this ex. is for: day 5, part 1)  
- `npm run test` - run tests for all solution scripts
